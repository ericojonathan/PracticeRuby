This is a practice problem to create a method of finding the root of
a single digit. For example, for a digit of 8, it should return an 8.
However, if it's 12, for example, it should return 3.

Some other examples,

256 = 2 + 5 + 6
    = 7 + 6
    = 13
    = 4

544 = 5 + 4 + 4
    = 9 + 4
    = 13
    = 4
